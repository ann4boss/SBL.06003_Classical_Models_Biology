###Discussion of the results###
##Case 1:
#Two species can coexist when the intraspecific competition (alpha11 and alpha22) is greater than interspecific competition.
#Therefore, this following has to be true: alpha11*alpha22 > alpha12*alpha21.
#Additionally, the initial conditions has to be positive (>0) for both species.

##Case 2 and Case 3:
#For one species to win over the other species, the following two conditions have to be true (example for Species 1):
#r1/alpha12 > r2/alpha22: Species 1 can invade when Species 2 is at equilibrium and
#r2/alpha21 < r1/alpha11: Species 2 cannot invade when Species 1 is at equilibrium
#The surviving species will reach an equilibrium at carrying capacity K = r1/alpha11 or K = r2/alpha22 for Species 1 and Species 2, respectively.


#Case 4:
#


# Notes: (can be deleted)
# r:intrinsic growth rates
# alpha11, alpha22: intraspecific competition
# alpha12, alpha21: interspecific competition
# coexisting equilibrium: dN1/dt=0 and dN2/dt=0
# this leads to:
# r1 = alpha11*N1 + alpha12*N2 &
# r2 = alpha21*N1 + alpha22*N2
# matrix form: A * N = b

# moves through the analytical equilibrium point and away from it -> unstable

# Discussion of the results

# With higher intrinsic growth rates (r1 = 12, r2 = 10) and moderate mutualistic
# coefficients (gamma12 = 0.5, gamma21 = 0.3), the system settles at a positive coexistence
# The two isoclines intersect at a positive equilibrium indicated in purple.

# The phase plane shows the isoclines intersecting in the positive quadrant, with
# the vector field and trajectory both clearly converging towards the equilibrium point.
# The stability analysis confirmed this, as the Jacobian matrix had eigenvalues
# with negative real parts (lambda_1 = -6.768772 < 0, lambda_2 = -2.600878),
# indicating a locally stable node.

# For the totality of the system this means that :
# Both species benefit from each other but not excessively. Density-dependent
# self-limitation stabilises the system.



# In the second example (r1 = 1.2, r2 = 1.0, alpha11 = 1.6, alpha22 = 1.35,
# gamma12 = 0.6, gamma21 = 0.5), the system also has a positive coexistence equilibrium,
# but the behaviour is very different:


# Here, the mutualistic terms (gamma12 = 0.6, gamma21 = 0.5) are stronger relative
# to the intrinsic growth rates and self-limitation. Despite the trajectory starting
# close to the equilibrium point (purple), it quickly diverges. The vector field flows
# away from the intersection point, and the Jacobian matrix reveals one
# eigenvalue with a positive real part (lambda_1 = -0.50350466 < 0,
# lambda_2 = 0.09382725 > 0), indicating that this coexistence point
# is locally unstable.


# For the totality of the system this means that :
# Mutualistic interactions are too strong compared to self-limitation. This means
# that the mutualistic feedback loops can overpower self regulation and a small
# small can already be enough to push the system into uncontrolled growth also
# called runaway amplification (in this case) or collapse.
